Package Cache
=================

Package cache aims to provide a local cache for various package managers,
including system managers(apt, dnf, ...) and language managers(pip, npm, ...).

This project is intended to be used in small CI systems, accelerating builds without maintain a full
copy of all available packages.

.. note::

   This project is currently under development. We will add more document once basic functions are available.
